### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2018

+ Projec title: Happy Moments for Generations of American
+ This project is conducted by Sheng Wang
+ This project is saved in doc folder: doc/Project1_sw3224.Rmd and doc/Project1_sw3224.html

+ Project summary: In 20th century, USA has five generation groups: the Greatest Generation (or GI Generation), the Silent Generation, baby boomers, Generation X and millennials. About this project, I curiously thought about how different generations will responded this same question "What made you happy today?" or "What made you happy last 3 month?". In order to examine happy moments for different generation groups, I will explore the texts using tools from text mining and natural language processing.
